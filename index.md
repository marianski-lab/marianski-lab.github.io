### News from the lab:

> **04/21/2023**: New DoD Grant for development of SCR-based sensors for virus detections has been awarded! 

> **04/19/2023**: Congratulations to Murat for winning the 2023 Student Award "Breaking Boundaries Award for Cross Cutting Computational Research" at NanoBioNYC for his work on Fucose migration in [Blood Group epitopes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.202302883)!

### Who we are and what we do:

We are computational chemists: computational chemistry gives us an unparalleled ability to visualize, with atomic – or even electronic – resolution, the mechanistic underpinning of physical, chemical, and biochemical processes, and in effect, provide a crucial insight into most challenging questions in the development of novel therapeutic strategies, and chemical synthesis.

Our research are focused around five main areas, three of which are connected by the theme of carbohydrates: 1) Mechanochemistry: Altering chemical reactions with a mechanical force; 2) Glycosylation: Improving stereocontrol of a glycosylation reaction; 3) Glycoanalysis: Understanding structure-function relationship in glycans; 4) Site-specific biolabeling: Designing new generation of site-specific labels of IgGs; and 5) Antivirals: Exploiting glycans as a target for novel antivirals.
