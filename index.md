# Welcome to the Marianski Group at Hunter College

---

### Who we are and what we do:

We are computational chemists - computational chemistry gives us an unparalleled ability to visualize, with atomic – or even electronic – resolution, the mechanistic underpinning of physical, chemical, and biochemical processes, and in effect, provide a crucial insight into most challenging questions in the development of novel therapeutic strategies, and chemical synthesis.

Our research is focused around five main areas, three of which are connected by the theme of carbohydrates: 1) Mechanochemistry: Altering chemical reactions with a mechanical force; 2) Glycosylation: Improving stereocontrol of a glycosylation reaction; 3) Glycoanalysis: Understanding structure-function relationship in glycans; 4) Site-specific biolabeling: Designing new generation of site-specific labels of IgGs; and 5) Antivirals: Exploiting glycans as a target for novel antivirals.
