# Welcome to the Marianski Group Website

Computational chemistry gives us an unparalleled ability to visualize, with atomic – or even electronic – resolution, the mechanistic underpinning of physical, chemical, and biochemical processes, and in effect, provide a crucial insight into most challenging questions in the development of novel therapeutic strategies, and chemical synthesis.

The research interest at Marianski lab at Hunter College CUNY ranges from a single bond formation under applied mechanical force to noncovalent interactions between the most complex biomolecules in biology. The tools we apply to investigate these problems are tailored to the specific demands of these problems. For instance, investigating a bond formation process necessitates methods that explicitly consider the molecular electronic structure, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT). On the other end of the spectrum, understanding recognition between large biomolecules, such as binding of synthetic carbohydrate receptors to a glycan portion of a protein, merits methods of classical molecular simulations. Finally, some other problems, such as glycoside reactions in an enzymatic center under mechanical stress, will require both quantum and classical approaches merged in a QM/MM scheme.

Our research are focused around five main areas, three of which are connected by the theme of carbohydrates: 1) Mechanochemistry: Altering chemical reactions with a mechanical force; 2) Glycosylation: Improving stereocontrol of a glycosylation reaction; 3) Glycoanalysis: Understanding structure-function relationship in glycans; 4) Site-specific biolabeling: Designing new generation of site-specific labels of IgGs; and 5) Antivirals: Exploiting glycans as a target for novel antivirals.
