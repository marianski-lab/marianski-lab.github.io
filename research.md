# Research focus at Marianski group:

---

The research provides excellent opportunity to gain an understanding of concepts ubiquitous in all branches of chemistry like basics of bio- and glycochemistry, as well as more advanced concepts of quantum mechanics, molecular energy landscapes and reaction mechanisms. Moreover, research in the theoretical chemistry lab will teach basics of scripting/programing (linux, bash, python, perl, C++…) and data-analysis skills.

### 1. Mechanochemistry: Altering organic reactions with mechanical forces

Background: The organic solvents employed in the great majority of organic reactions carried out in industry account for >60% of all chemical manufacturing waste. Because of the energy demand of so-called solvothermal syntheses, where solvent and heat drive reactions, the chemical industry consumes 37% of the total energy used in manufacturing. Replacing solvothermal with mechanically-activated organic chemistry – where force, rather than heat and solvent, drives the making and breaking of covalent bonds – can solve the waste and energy challenges of organic synthesis. Mechanochemically-activated conditions can also yield stereoisomers and regioisomers that are not favored under solvothermal conditions. Despite its many potential advantages, significant gaps in the understanding of reaction kinetics under mechanochemical activation limits adoption of mechanochemistry in chemical synthesis and manufacturing.

### 2. Glycosylation Reaction: Reviving the reaction mechanism with molecular simulations

Carbohydrates - or glycans - play an essential role in a variety of biochemical processes, such as cell-cell communication, and immune system recognition. Being the identification card of a cell, glycans have given rise to over 170 commercial drugs and vaccines that exploit their functions. However,
carbohydrate-based drugs and vaccines remain niche on account of their complex and time-consuming synthesis, which necessitates scrupulous control over the regio- and stereoselctivity of the glycosidic bond formation.

The glycosylation reaction couples a glycosyl donor to an acceptor and proceeds through an idiosyncratic glycosyl-donor intermediate, which is believed to exist as a continuum of potential intermediates. The dominant structure will then orchestrate the reaction mechanism, and the ability to in fluence this dominant intermediate is essential to establish better stereochemical control over the reaction. In previous work, by combining high-throughput DFT calculations, and a cryogenic-ion IR spectroscopy (prof. Kevin Pagel/FHI of the Max Planck Society, Berlin), we have shown that the glycosyl donors intermediates equipped with the protecting groups at positions C2[1] or C4[2] adopt a dioxolenium-type of a structure.

Importantly, we demonstrated that the formation of this type of an intermediate correlates with the stereoselectivity of the glycosylation reaction, which proofs that the fine-tuning of the stereoelectronic properties of the protecting groups can significantly influence the outcome of the reac-
tion.

### 3. Glycoanalysis: Fingerprints please – fragment-based analysis of glycans in a gas phase

Glycan expression and composition in the glycocalyx – the layer of glycolipids, glycoproteins, and glycopolymers on the surface of all eukaryotic cells as well as many bacteria and viruses – have been correlated to developmental status, cell type, and the disease state of a cell. These cell-, tissue-, and species-specific inventories of glycans comprise the “sugar code”, but much of this encoded information remains undeciphered, leaving critical gaps in knowledge about biological processes and networks that could be exploited to treat disease. Thus, there remains a need for new tools to ana
lyze and utilize the information buried within the glycocalyx. One promising technique is combining gas-phase analysis of carbohydrates, using techniques such as mass-spectrometry (MS), ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) or action IR spectroscopy, with high-throughput DFT calculations. 

While working at the FHI Berlin (prof. Kevin Pagel), we have established that 1) DFT provides excellent theoretical framework to study carbohydrates in a gas phase;[1] and 2) glycans have unique IR fingerprints that can be used to decode their structure.[2] Synergy between these two techniques en- abled us to study the sequence-structure relationship in glycans,[3] and glycosphingolipids.[4] We proposed, that the combination of computational and experimental techniques can be used to create a reference library to facilitate fragment-based analysis of glycans.[5] In a recent contribution, we have combined several gas-phase techniques and high-throughput DFT calculations to reveal the rearrangement products of the fucose migration in blood
group epitopes.[6] The computational work has also catalyzed the development of Carbohydrate Parser in python (CarPpy) which streamlines the DFT computations, and the subsequent analysis, of carbohydrates.[7]

### 4. Site-specific Biolabeling: In silico design of new generation of well-defined mAb labels

In recent years, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) became one of the most promising plarforms in oncology to deliver a payload – most commonly in a form of antibody-drug conjugates – to malignant tissue. The prevalence of lysinines on the surface of mAb make them a promising target for the labeling with amine-reactive groups, however the result may differ with respect to both the number of payloads added per mAb and the location of those payloads. The development of site-specific labels, which target only one desired site on the mAb, which result in immonoconjugates with well-defined and optimal in vitro and in vivo behavior. 


### 5. Antivirals: Can viral glycans be targeted to detect and stop viral diseases?

The recognition events between glycans and receptors have a central role in the viral life cycle. Understanding how these binding processes are involved in pathogen infection and reproduction could lead to new and desperately needed antiviral agents to counter the threat of viral outbreaks, especially those posed by enveloped viruses (EnV). The glycans can be either on proteins on the viral envelope, such as oligomannosides on the surface of Dengue Virus binding to the host cell protein DC-SIGN, or on the host cell, such as N-linked glycans terminated by sialic acid which are targets for influenza virus. Being able to inhibit these interactions will open new therapeutic strategies for novel antivirals. 

In collaboration with prof. Adam Braunschweig (ASRC CUNY), we have synthesized a large library of over 80 synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs), and characterized their binding towards biologically-relevant carbohydrates. As a part of a DoD AFOSR grant,[a] we have established design rules to anticipate the SCR selectivity and to optimize its binding affinity.[1−4] Importantly, these  SCRs show strong antiviral activity. We hypothesize that  the SCRs interact with N-glycans on the surface of EnV,  which leads to the inhibition of the docking of a virus to  a host cell (Figure 6). Thanks to an award from Covid- 19 HPC consortium,[b] we have demonstrated, using MD  simulations, that SCRs are selective towards specific N-glycans, abundance of which correlates with the measured antiviral activity of SCRs.[5]
