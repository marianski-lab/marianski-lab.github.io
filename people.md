> ### Lusila Vranga
> **Research Interest:** Lusila investigates interactions between synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCR) and the glycans that are present in the COVID-19 spike protein. The goal is to create a SCR that would affect the viral activity of the virus by attaching to the glycans that play a crucial role in this activity.
