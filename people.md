> <img src="/assets/img/DDave.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200" class="left" align="left"/>
>
> **Research Interest:** Understanding how supramolecular interactions of biological building blocks such as amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates. influences properties of materials with applications ranging from catalysis to food-additives. In order to achieve his goals, he uses combination of experimental (at ASRC) as well as computational methods.

## Undergraduate students:

### Lusila Vranga

>
> **Research Interest:** Lusila investigates interactions between synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCR) and the glycans that are present in the COVID-19 spike protein. The goal is to create a SCR that would affect the viral activity of the virus by attaching to the glycans that play a crucial role in this activity.
> 
> **Methods:** Molecular dynamics simulations (VMD).


### Vasilis Kontodimas
