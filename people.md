# Current group members:

## Graduate students:

### <a href="btapia@gradcenter.cuny.edu">Beicer Tapia</a> 

**Research Interest:** (1) Principles of the molecular recognition between the syntehtic carbohydrate receptors and complex glycans and recognition of glycans as viable targets for synthetic molecules for sensors, drugs development and viral binding inhibition. (2) The sequence-structure relation in carbohydrates for discovery of novel carbohydrate-based materials.  

**Methods:** Molecular dynamics simulations (gromacs) and data analysis (python)

### <a href="ddave@gradcenter.cuny.edu">Dhwanit Dave</a> (Member of Rein Uljin group at ASRC)

**Research Interest:** Understading how supramolecular interactions of biological building blocks such as amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates. influences properties of materials with applications ranging from catalysis to food-additives. In order to achieve his goals, he uses combination of experimental (at ASRC) as well as computational methods.

**Methods:** Molecular dynamics simulations (gromacs), quantum calculations (Gaussian16) and data analysis (python). 


#### Research Interest: 

## Undergraduate students:

### Genrietta Yagdayeva

**Research Interest:** Gretta looks at binding between synthetic carbohydrate receptors and a class of O-glycans, common modification of proteins, using methods of molecular dynamics simulations.

**Methods** : Molecular dynamics (gromacs) and data analysis (python) 

### Shonel Rahim 

**Research Interest:** Shonel works at python implementation of a package for numeric analysis of IR-vibrational spectral sigunatures of small molecules derived from quantum calculations. 

**Methods:** Software development (python-3.6)

### Ryan Kwok 

**Research Interest:** Ryans uses methods of density-functional theory to investigate how modification of the electronic properties of participating groups of glycosyl donor affect the stereochemical output of the glycosylation reaction.  

**Methods:** Quantum chemical calculations (Gaussian16 and FHI-aims)
